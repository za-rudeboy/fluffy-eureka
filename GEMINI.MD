This document summarizes the actions taken to complete Phase 3.3 of the technical specification.

## Phase 3.3: Create Container App within Managed Environment

The goal was to add a hello-world container app to the existing managed environment in the `container-compute.bicep` file, deploying the `hello-world-gh` image from GitHub Container Registry.

### Actions Taken:

1. **Read Current Infrastructure:**
   - Examined the existing `infrastructure/container-compute.bicep` file to understand the current managed environment setup.

2. **Enhanced Bicep Template:**
   - Added new parameters: `containerAppName` and `githubOwner` to the Bicep template
   - Added a `Microsoft.App/containerApps@2025-01-01` resource that:
     - References the managed environment created in Phase 3.2
     - Configures external ingress on port 80
     - Deploys the `ghcr.io/${githubOwner}/hello-world-gh:latest` image
     - Sets resource limits (0.25 CPU, 0.5Gi memory)
     - Configures scaling from 0-1 replicas

3. **Updated GitHub Workflow:**
   - Modified the `.github/workflows/hello-world.yml` workflow step
   - Changed step name from "Create Container App Managed Environment" to "Deploy Container App and Managed Environment"
   - Added new parameters to the deployment: `containerAppName=ca-hello-world` and `githubOwner=${{ github.repository_owner }}`

### Key Configuration Details:

- **Container App Name:** `ca-hello-world`
- **Image Source:** GitHub Container Registry (`ghcr.io`)
- **Image Tag:** Uses `v0.1` tag (updated from `latest`)
- **Ingress:** External access enabled on port 80
- **Resources:** 0.25 CPU cores, 0.5Gi memory
- **Scaling:** Minimum 0 replicas, maximum 1 replica
- **Traffic Distribution:** 100% to latest revision

### Result:

Phase 3.3 is now complete. The infrastructure now deploys both the Container App Managed Environment and the hello-world Container App in a single workflow step, creating a complete Azure Container Apps solution that pulls the Docker image built in earlier phases from GitHub Container Registry.
