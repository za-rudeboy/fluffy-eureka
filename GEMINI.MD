## Phase 3.2: Create Container App Managed Environment

The goal was to create an Azure Container App Managed Environment using Bicep and deploy it via a GitHub Actions workflow.

### Actions Taken:

1.  **Created Bicep File:**
    *   A new file was created at `infrastructure/container-compute.bicep` to define the `Microsoft.App/managedEnvironments` resource.

2.  **Updated GitHub Workflow:**
    *   The `.github/workflows/hello-world.yml` file was modified to add a new deployment step for the `container-compute.bicep` template.

### Corrections and Refinements:

Throughout the process, several corrections were made to both the Bicep template and the workflow file to resolve deployment errors:

*   **Bicep - `sku` Property:** The initial Bicep file contained an invalid `sku` property for the `Microsoft.App/managedEnvironments@2025-01-01` resource type, which was removed.
*   **Bicep - `properties` Object:** The deployment failed because the `managedEnvironment` resource was missing a required, empty `properties` object. This was added to the Bicep file.
*   **Workflow - Deployment Scope:** The workflow step for the managed environment was incorrectly set to a `subscription` scope. It was corrected to `resourceGroup`.
*   **Workflow - Parameters:** The workflow step was updated to correctly pass the `location` parameter to the Bicep template.
